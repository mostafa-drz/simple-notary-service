### Submit a star

 <ol>
 <li>You have to request for wallet address verification by sending request to http://localhost:8000/requestValidation and in your body of your request you have to send the address of your wallet.
 example:<br/>
  {address:"kdnawidn39e29eu2jne219eue291ue0"}
 </li>
 <li>When you send the request for validation on the first step, you'll receive a response including a message that you have to sign in your wallet by the address you provided. After signing the message send the signature to the  http://localhost:8000/message-signature/validate. in the body of your request you have to provide the address and signature. Example:<br/>
 {
  "address": "142BDCeSGbXjWKaAnYXbMpZ6sbrSAo3DpZ",
  "signature": "H6ZrGrF0Y4rMGBMRT2+hHWGbThTIyhBS0dNKQRov9Yg6GgXcHxtO9GJN4nwD2yNXpnXHTWU9i+qdw5vpsooryLU="
}
<br/>
Remember, from the first step, you only have 5 minutes to finish the whole process. 
 </li>
 <li>if you are successful in verifying your wallet address, now you can submit a star by sending the star info to "http://localhost:8000/block". Example:<br/> 
 {
  "address": "142BDCeSGbXjWKaAnYXbMpZ6sbrSAo3DpZ",
  "star": {
    "dec": "-26Â° 29'\\'' 24.9",
    "ra": "16h 29m 1.0s",
    "story": "Found star using https://www.google.com/sky/"
  }
 </li>
 </ol>
